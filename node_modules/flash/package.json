You may simply run the\nfollowing command inside your shell to get it going.\n\n    npm install flash -g\n\nDocumentation for installing Node.js and the Node Package Manager can\nbe found at [the Node.js homepage](http://nodejs.org)\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nCreate, and start an example application\n\n    flash init test-application --template=blog-application\n    cd blog-application\n    flash run\n    # server running on localhost:29547\n\n## Deployment\n\nWe provide a simple cloud application service for running your flash\napplications. An account registration is required, and hosting will\naffect your account usage. If you are offering an open source\napplication, send us an email and we can look into setting you up with\na free shared account.\n\nTo provide a secondary option for users\nwishing to remain independent you can deploy and run any application\nusing traditional Node.js techniques. \n\n### Hosted\n\nYou can use any domain or subdomain to host an flash\napplication, simply create a `CNAME` record with your DNS provider\nthat points to `quiver.onfrst.com`.\n\n    # inside of a project\n    flash deploy [site-url]\n\n### Private\n\nIn order to deploy a private installation of your application you will\nneed to build your application and send it where it will be\nrun. Wherever you have decided to host your application, you may\nsimply start it up with a traditional node command. \n\nThe `build` command includes all dependencies, so the platform you use\nto build should be similar to your hosted environment.\n\n    # in your build environment\n    flash build\n    scp [project-name].tgz [site-url]:/home/user/\n\n    # on your remote host\n    tar xzf [project-name].tgz\n    cd [project-name]\n    node [main-file].js\n\nIt should be as easy as that in all deployment cases. Setting up your\nservers users, directories, application services are all left up to\nyou in most cases. Whether you use coffee-script or not, we compile\neverything into a clean `js` package.\n\n## Templates\n\nProject templates may be created & distributed easily. We include a\nnumber of useful project templates to get you started.\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 <%= @author.name %> <<%= @author.email %>>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
